***Mancala Project**
This is the first project of the CSC442.
Team member 1: Yuxuan He, Netid: yhe50
Team member 2: Guo Zheng, Netid: gzheng5
All the code, output figure and test table were written and generated by Yuxuan He and Guo Zheng.

*In this project, we build up a mancala game by python3.7, including human vs human, human vs AI and AI vs AI.

*To play the game, you should choose to run these three codes below
1.mancala_PvP, to play against a human player
2.mancala_PvAI, to play against an AI player. You can choose to play against the random AI or minimax AI.
3.mancala_AIvAI, this is a test code, to compare the ability of each algorithm, but you can also run this code, and the AI will show you how they play

*Also, there are two codes named GameAI and GameAI_no_pruning. They are the algorithm code of minimax and alphabeta.

*The Analysis is the code to generate the 2 .png file, which show the results to reach the requirements of project 1.

*The test.xml recording the results of each experiment.

*the file experiment vs minimax/rand records the printscreens of the complete process we play against minimax AI/random AI

*The file of test includes some of the test we took to examine the codes.

Thanks for reading.
Hope it works with you.
